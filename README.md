Tic Tac Toe Project
Produce documentation in the form of a README, which must:

Link to your hosted game in the URL section of your Github repo.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, javascript, Sass, Bootstraps, Ajax, jQuery

Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and
problem-solving strategy.
I am setting out to create a working game without much in the way of bells and
whistles. I feel confident in the user login aspect of the game. I am most
concerned about the gameboeard itself. I will tackle probelm solving with help
from classmatates, consultants, and web searches.

List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.

Link to wireframes and user stories.
Your app must:

Be a single-page application.
Use a custom game engine written by you.
Be deployed online, where the rest of the world can access it.
Render a game board in the browser.
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select).
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a
draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins.
Support playing multiple games, one at a time.
Use jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.
Use AJAX for interacting with a provided API. Specifically, your app must:

Visually display the results of retrieving game statistics, such as total games
won by a user. (READ)
Create new games on the server. (CREATE)
Update a game by storing new moves. (UPDATE)
Have login, logout, and change password functionality.

Your app must not:

Rely on refreshing the page for any functionality.
Display non-functional buttons, nor buttons that do not successfully complete a
task.
Have any user-facing bugs.
Be playable after finishing a game.
Allow players to move in the same square more than once.
Change players when an invalid move is made.
Additionally, you should:

Use semantic HTML.
Practice separation of concerns by:

Using the js-template to store HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the appropriate
places.
Storing DOM manipulation code and network code in separate files.
KISS (Keep It Stupidly Simple).

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
Finally, you should not:

Use alerts for anything.
Display errors or warnings in the console.
Display debugging messages in the console.
