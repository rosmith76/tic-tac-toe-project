I am setting out to create a working game without much in the way of bells and
whistles. I feel confident in the user login aspect of the game. I am most
concerned about the gameboeard itself. I will tackle probelm solving with help
from classmatates, consultants, and web searches.

List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
I need to figure out how to clear the board array when the new game nutton is
pushed.

Link to wireframes and user stories.
